# JavaScript module final exercise: Anime series finder.

This exercise has been done as part of the final exam of the JavaScript module in Adalab.

# Project description.

In this exercise we have created a web page to search for anime series titles. There is also the option to mark as favourites the series that we like the most, and the favorites section will remain there when you reload the page.
For this we have used HTML5 markup language, to which we have applied some styles with CSS3 and we have developed the functionality through JavaScript, using arrow functions, lopps, array's methods, conditionals, events and their corresponding handler functions (and therefore callbacks).

To develop this project we have used two branches: main, which contains the stable version, and dev to add new features or style changes in a more controlled way. Every time the new feature stabilized in development, we merged it with main.

The result is published on GitHub Pages and you can see it [here](http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-SandML3/). I hope you like it!

# Tecnhnologies.

For this we have used the Adalab Web Starter Kit (AWSK), created with node and gulp. Among other things, ADWSK includes an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor, and a local server. Thanks to this, we have been able to split the code into partials.
